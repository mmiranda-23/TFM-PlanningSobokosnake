# TFM-PlanningSobokosnake

This repository was created as a resource for my master's thesis.
The project consisted of creating a PDDL domain for the game Sobokosnake ( [explanation of the game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2083650/SobokoSnake/), [demo](https://sobodev.itch.io/sokosnake) ) and 22 different problems, which were executed in 7 planners of the classical satisficing track from IPC 2018. Planners were then compared.
